# Project Governance

Enigma Desktop Copilot operates under a lightweight, transparent governance model to ensure timely decision-making and community trust.

## Roles

- **Maintainers** — Trusted contributors with triage permissions and merge rights.
- **Contributors** — Community members submitting issues, PRs, or documentation updates.

## Decision Making
