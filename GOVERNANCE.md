# Governance

Copliot Enigma follows a lightweight, meritocratic governance model. Responsibilities are distributed across three roles:

## Maintainers

- Own the project vision and roadmap
- Review and merge pull requests
- Publish releases and security advisories
- Steward community health and inclusive conduct

Current maintainers: `@danycrafts` (project lead), `@copliot-core` (automation lead).

## Contributors

- Submit pull requests, issues, and RFCs
- Participate in design discussions
- Share knowledge through documentation and demos

Contributors earn voting rights on roadmap RFCs after three significant merged pull requests in the last 12 months.

## Decision making

1. **Minor changes** (bug fixes, docs, refactors) are merged once a maintainer approves.
2. **Feature work** requires a written proposal (issue label `type:rfc`) and consensus from at least two maintainers.
3. **Breaking changes** require a recorded architecture discussion and a two-thirds majority of maintainers.

Disagreements are resolved through open discussion. If consensus cannot be reached, the project lead acts as the final arbiter while documenting reasoning for transparency.

## Meetings

We host a public planning sync on the first Thursday of each month at 16:00 UTC. Notes are published in the `docs/meetings` directory.

## Amendments

Governance changes require an RFC and a majority maintainer vote.
